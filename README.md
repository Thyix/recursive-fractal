### Fractal tree and Korch snowflake recursive drawing

###### The goal of this project is to make simple, multicolored recursive drawings that can also be manipulated randomly. I realized it all by recreating a fractal tree and the korch snowflake.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have following installed:

  - [Visual Studio 2017 Entreprise](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/license-terms/mlt551018/)
  - [OpenCV 3.x](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) **with contribution package**
  - A Webcamera ! (Personnaly, I have this one ([click here](https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/high-definition-dual-hdmi-and-usb-cameras/14263/)))

## Compile and run

As simple as:

```c++
$ make
$ bin/track
```

or by debugging the whole program in **Visual Studio**

The tracking program runs until you press `Echap`. Tab `Ctrl + C` inside your terminal 
window to terminate.

## Disclaimer

The build is configured to perfectly fit on Windows 10 (Visual Studio Entreprise 2017). 
Your mileage may vary if you are compiling the code on a different OS.
